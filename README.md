# EastRiver_NO3
This repo contains the code and data for spatiotemporal analysis of NO3 in the East River.
Descriptions of code files below:

Figure_2 (R) - analysis and plot code associated with discharge, SWE, and atmospheric deposition in the East River

Figures_3_and_4 (R) - analysis and plot code associated with comparison of long term and seasonal NO3 for the East and Slate Rivers

MLR_Figure5 (R) - analysis and plot code associated with East River seasonal multiple linear regression models

Figure6b (R) - plot code for average percent change in NO3 at each confluence on the Slate (from synoptic sampling)

Supplemental (R) - analysis and plot code for supplemental figures 1-3 (East River NO3 concentraion and atmospheric deposition, annual WRTDS output NO3 vs other variables, synoptic sampling event box plot)

FigureS4 (Python; Jupytr notebook) - analysis and plot code for supplemental figure 4 (day of peak swe, days above freezing, days below freezing, and spring freezing days)
